=====================================================================================

Our third project for our full-stack coding bootcamp, TruckTracker is a Food Truck locator application that provides users with the location and business information of Food Trucks near them. Food Trucks can also create an account and submit a business application. Once approved by an administrator, the Food Truck can log-in to the application and update their current location with a press of a button. Users will be able to view the truck's real-time location using google maps API. 

#### Landing Page
![website](/public/TruckTrackerSignIn.png "TruckTracker")

###### For our application, we have used firebase authentication and allow users the option to sign in with their google or facebook account.

#### Business Application Page
![Food Truck Application](/public/TTApplication.png "Food Truck Application")

###### Once the Food Truck Owner has made an account, the first thing they want to do is fill out an application. This information will be reviewed by an Admin and the owner will be contacted if we have any questions. The information we receive is stored on mySql and once that application is approved by an admin, the business owner will be able to update their live location on their dashboard/home page. 

#### Business Owner Dashboard
![Food Truck Owner Dashboard](/public/TTHomePage.png "Food Truck Owner Dashboard")

###### With a simple click of a button, the Food Truck may update their current location and leave the button active until they move locations or close out for the day. We use firebase to store the Food Truck's current location.

#### Business Owner Account Page

###### If for whatever reason, the business owner wishes to change their account password, we allow them two methods to do so on their account page.


#### Forget Password

#### Sign Up

## Decoupled Application

This is a decoupled application. We have an SQL server that only serves to create, update, and render JSON Data deployed on Heroku found [here](https://api-food-truck.herokuapp.com/). 

Our react app is hosted on an entirely different server found [here](https://trucktrackerdemo.herokuapp.com/). We built to make it easier for us in the future to build the front end later using react native or another method.


## üîë How to Use the App:

The application is intuitive and requires little to no prior knowledge before being ready to use.

Follow the steps below if you are a Food Truck Business:

=================================================================
Our third project for our full-stack coding bootcamp, TruckTracker is a Food Truck locator application that provides users with the location and business information of Food Trucks near them. Food Trucks can also create an account and submit a business application. Once approved by an administrator, the Food Truck can log-in to the application and update their current location with a press of a button. Users will be able to view the truck's real-time location on a google map.

## Decoupled Application

This is a decoupled application. We have an SQL server that only serves to create, update, and render JSON Data deployed on Heroku found [here](https://api-food-truck.herokuapp.com/). 

Our react app is hosted on an entirely different server found [here](https://trucktrackerdemo.herokuapp.com/). We built to make it easier for us in the future to build the front end later using react native or another method.
